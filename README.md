# Patient Tracker üë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è‚è±

This application intends to track patients through multi-step clinical processes and upload this data to a data store.

Each patient has a QR code that can be scanned, placing them in a rudimentary queue. The queue

### Getting started

Patient Tracker is powered by JavaScript and the React Native framework.

#### 1. Clone the repository

Clone this repository with your favourite git client!

#### 2. Set up your editor

You can use any editor you like for this application, but I would recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It has a number of great pre-built extensions for modern code editing and is absolutely free. It has an extension system letting it support all kinds of languages and tools in a helpful manner.

Open up the root directory of this repo in the editor for the best and most comprehensive view around the project.

#### 3. Install the dependencies

- Ensure you have [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine. This will run our code. The LTS (long term support) version is fine!
- Ensure you have [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) installed
- In the root of this repository run the `yarn` command to install project dependencies. This will go to a repository called `npm` and fetch all the little extra bits of public code our project relies on.

#### 4. Running code on our phones

If you have an android device, great! Install `expo` on it, which you can find in the Google Play app store. If not, launching an emulator will do fine.

Run `yarn start` in the terminal and React Native will start putting code together into a bundle. When it's done, it'll show a QR code that you can scan with the `expo` android app and ta-da, your code _magically_ runs on the device. If you're running an emulator on your machine, Patient Tracker without need for a QR scan.

If you're having a problem with this part, check out the [React Native docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started#running-your-react-native-application);
